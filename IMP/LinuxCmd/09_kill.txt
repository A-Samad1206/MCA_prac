UNIX signals
kill -l = In UNIX-like OS, give a list signal that can be used along with kill command to send signals to process.

Certainly, here are concise definitions for all the standard Unix signals:

1. `SIGHUP`: Hangup signal. Often used to request a process to reload its configuration or restart.

2. `SIGINT`: Interrupt signal. Typically sent to a process when the user presses Ctrl+C to terminate it gracefully.

3. `SIGQUIT`: Quit signal. Similar to SIGINT but also generates a core dump for debugging.

4. `SIGILL`: Illegal instruction signal. Sent when a process attempts to execute an invalid CPU instruction.

5. `SIGTRAP`: Trap signal. Used for debugging purposes, such as setting breakpoints.

6. `SIGABRT`: Abort signal. Usually raised by the process itself to indicate a critical error.

7. `SIGBUS`: Bus error signal. Raised when there's a memory access error aligned on a memory boundary.

8. `SIGFPE`: Floating-Point Exception signal. Generated for arithmetic errors, such as division by zero.

9. `SIGKILL`: Kill signal. Forces immediate termination of a process and cannot be caught or ignored.

10. `SIGUSR1` and 11. `SIGUSR2`: User-defined signals. These signals are available for custom use.

12. `SIGSEGV`: Segmentation Fault signal. Occurs when a process accesses a memory location it's not allowed to.

13. `SIGPIPE`: Broken Pipe signal. Raised when writing to a closed pipe or socket.

14. `SIGALRM`: Alarm Clock signal. Generated by the `alarm` function for timing operations.

15. `SIGTERM`: Termination signal. Requests a process to terminate gracefully.

16. `SIGSTKFLT`: Stack Fault signal. Indicates stack overflow or certain stack-related issues.

17. `SIGCHLD`: Child Status Changed signal. Sent when a child process exits or stops.

18. `SIGCONT`: Continue signal. Used to resume a stopped process.

19. `SIGSTOP` and 20. `SIGTSTP`: Stop signals. Halt a process, and it can be resumed with the `SIGCONT` signal.

21. `SIGTTIN` and 22. `SIGTTOU`: Terminal Input and Output signals. Sent to background processes that attempt terminal I/O.

23. `SIGURG`: Urgent data available on a socket signal.

24. `SIGXCPU` and 25. `SIGXFSZ`: CPU and File Size Exceeded signals. Raised when resource limits are exceeded.

26. `SIGVTALRM` and 27. `SIGPROF`: Virtual Timer and Profiling Timer signals.

28. `SIGWINCH`: Window Size Change signal.

29. `SIGIO` and 30. `SIGPWR`: I/O and Power Fail signals.

31. `SIGSYS`: Bad System Call signal. Raised when a process makes an invalid system call.

32. `SIGRTMIN` through 64. `SIGRTMAX`: Real-time signals for user-defined purposes. There are a range of real-time signals available for custom use.
