Server Block - 
In Nginx, a "server block" is a configuration block that defines how the web server should respond to 
requests for a specific domain or virtual host. 
Each server block is associated with a particular server name (domain) and may contain directives that 
specify how Nginx should handle incoming HTTP requests for that domain.

The `server_name` directive within a server block specifies the domain or hostname for which the 
configuration should apply. For example:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        # Configuration for the root location ("/")
        # ...
    }

    location /images {
        # Configuration for requests to /images
        # ...
    }
}



In this example:

- The server block listens on port 80 and is configured for the domain "example.com."
- It contains two `location` blocks: one for the root URL ("/") and another for requests to the "/images" path.
- Within each `location` block, you can specify various directives to define how Nginx should handle requests, 
such as proxying requests to an application, serving static files, or setting specific response headers.

Server blocks allow you to host multiple websites or web applications on the same Nginx server by specifying different 
`server_name` values and configuring how requests to each domain or path should be processed. This makes Nginx a 
powerful and flexible web server for managing multiple websites or applications on a single server.


Steps 
1.) Make an index file in /var/www/html/mysite
2.) Create a server block in sites-available/
3.) Create a symlink from sites-enabled
4.) nginx -t
5.) restart nginx service
