Arrow Key Escape Sequences
The problem of encountering unexpected or incorrect characters when pressing arrow keys in a terminal or text editor like 
Vim is often referred to as "Arrow Key Navigation" or "Arrow Key Escape Sequences" issues. 
These problems typically occur when there is a discrepancy between how the terminal emulator, the terminal itself, 
and the application (such as Vim) interpret the escape sequences sent by the arrow keys.
